**Population III Star Remnants and Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Seeds**

Quasars observed at redshifts z ≳ 7 host black holes with inferred masses approaching 10⁹ M☉ at cosmic ages below one gigayear. Any viable formation pathway must therefore satisfy strict constraints on initial seed mass, mass-growth rates, and available cosmic time.

This repository contains numerical treatments of Population III stellar remnants and their subsequent mass evolution under accretion- and merger-driven growth. The calculations examine whether physically reasonable remnant masses, coupled to standard growth prescriptions, can produce intermediate-mass black hole seeds capable of reaching quasar-scale masses within the allowed cosmological window.

Only leading-order mass assembly processes are treated. Gas effects, radiative feedback, and environmental form are not resolved. The purpose of the calculations is to present which regions of parameter space remain compatible with observed early quasar populations given conservative physical assumptions.
